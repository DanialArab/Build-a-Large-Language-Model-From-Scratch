This is my summary of Appendix A.

PyTorch three broad components:

First, PyTorch is a tensor library that extends the concept of the array-oriented programming
library NumPy with the additional feature that accelerates computation on
GPUs, thus providing a seamless switch between CPUs and GPUs. Second, PyTorch is
an automatic differentiation engine, also known as autograd, that enables the automatic
computation of gradients for tensor operations, simplifying backpropagation and
model optimization. Finally, PyTorch is a deep learning library. It offers modular, flexible,
and efficient building blocks, including pretrained models, loss functions, and
optimizers, for designing and training a wide range of deep learning models, catering
to both researchers and developers.
